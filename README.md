# SticktimeApp

A web app that aggregates open ice for local NY/CT hockey players.

This may break from time to time as rinks change their sites and APIs. Please make an issue if you notice that happen, I will try to keep this repo up-to-date.

### Pull Requests

Currently, there are not many rinks available. However, feel free to make a PR and check off another rink.

Some reverse engineering may be required.

- If they are using Daysmart Recreation, use your browser console to find the api request it is making (use Network tab and disable 3rd party requests only).
- If the site is not CSR, simply scrape the page.
- Otherwise, look at the APIs used and attempt to implement.
