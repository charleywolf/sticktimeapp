# SticktimeApp

A web app that aggregates open ice for local NY/CT hockey players.

This may break from time to time as rinks change their sites and APIs. Please make an issue if you notice that happen, I will try to keep this repo up-to-date.

## Contribute

If you would like to contribute, the best way would be to add a new rink. See the to-do list for ideas.

However, some reverse engineering may be required.

- If the site is CSR, use your browser console to find the api request it is making (use Network tab and disable 3rd party requests only).
- If the site is not CSR, scrape the page directly.
