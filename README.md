# SticktimeApp

Created for the local NY hockey area (mainly Westchester); basic Next.js app that lists open ice at multiple rinks.

This may break from time to time as rinks change their sites and APIs. Please make an issue if you notice that happen, I will try to keep this repo up-to-date.

### Pull Requests

Currently, there are not many rinks available. However, feel free to make a PR and check off another rink.

Some reverse engineering may be required.

- If they are using Daysmart Recreation, use your browser console to find the api request it is making (use Network tab and disable 3rd party requests only).
- If the site is not CSR, simply scrape the page.
- Otherwise, look at the APIs used and attempt to implement.
